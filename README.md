FlatShader: 
When creating my scene, I noticed there were empty spots on the left and right of the screen where the map doesn't line up. To cover these up, I decided to use a flat shader so it is just black bars on the 2 sides, otherwise it shows the unity backgroun,d which doesnt fit the scene. For the changes I made, I adjusted the base colour in the inspector to change it from a white colour to a black colour.

ToonShader:
The next shader that I used was the Toon Shader. I used this shader on Pac-Man himself in order to get the bright yellow colour. In the code, I amplified the rim power to 3 from 1.5 in order to make the rim more powerful without it taking over the model completely. I then fidgeted with the inspector to get a colour that I thought fit Pac-Man well
