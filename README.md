FlatShader: 
When creating my scene, I noticed there were empty spots on the left and right of the screen where the map doesn't line up. To cover these up, I decided to use a flat shader so it is just black bars on the 2 sides, otherwise it shows the unity backgroun,d which doesnt fit the scene. For the changes I made, I adjusted the base colour in the inspector to change it from a white colour to a black colour.
